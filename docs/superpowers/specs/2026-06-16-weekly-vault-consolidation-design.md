# Weekly Vault Consolidation — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Status:** Draft — pending review
**Scope:** Piece 1 of 3 of the "Vault Quality" initiative

---

## 1. Purpose

The `ViscapMedia/documentation` vault (an Obsidian vault + GitHub repo) is the source of truth that the PM app's FVI assessment and other agents read from. It has accumulated structural rot: duplicate folders (`Inbox`/`01_Inbox`, `Feature Planning`/`FeaturePlanning`), empty docs, orphaned files with no backlinks, stale docs, and inbox RFCs that never get filed. A disorganized vault directly degrades every assessment (noisier search hits, heavier context) and erodes trust in the docs.

This spec covers **Weekly Vault Consolidation**: a recurring, author-driven process that (a) reports what changed in the vault each week and (b) asks each doc's creator a short series of questions about their *stable* docs, applying the answers as link-safe changes via a reviewed PR.

It deliberately replaces a one-time "big prune" with a sustainable weekly cadence.

## 2. Background & connection to assessment quality

The assessment reads the vault live (`lib/github/vault.ts`: `searchVault`, `searchFeatureSpecs`, `readDevObjectives`). The vault already defines the metadata this design relies on (`00_Meta/Doc Standards.md`):

- `status:` lifecycle per doc — `current` / `stub` / `legacy` / `orphan` / `conceptual`
- `source:` provenance (the code/repo a doc describes) + a staleness check (`updated:` vs repo's last push)
- the **one-canonical-home rule** — each fact lives in exactly one place; duplicates are defects
- a defined taxonomy: `Manual/`, `02_Glossary/`, `Feature Overview/`, `Dev Docs/`, `SOPs/`, `Feature Planning/`, etc.

Existing tooling (`scripts/check-vault-sources.py`, `scripts/backfill_readme_frontmatter.py`) already audits `Dev Docs/GitHub READMEs/`. This design extends that philosophy to the whole vault and adds the human decision loop.

## 3. Scope

### In scope (v1)
- Weekly **change report** (read-only digest of vault git activity).
- **Stability gate**: docs whose latest commit is > 7 days old are eligible for consolidation.
- **Question generation** per stable doc, driven by deterministic audit heuristics + LLM phrasing.
- **Author routing** and **Slack Block Kit** delivery of questions.
- **Answer handling** → link-safe changes committed to a per-author weekly branch → one consolidated PR.
- Document lifecycle state recorded **in frontmatter** (`last_reviewed`, `review_status`).

### Out of scope (deferred)
- **Approve → branch / cascade / ClickUp wiring** when an inbox RFC is approved as a future feature → **Piece 2 (Inbox Triage & Approval)**. v1 only *tags* the doc and records the decision.
- **Assessment runtime scoping** (narrowing what each assessment loads) → **Piece 3**.
- **Auto-merge** of overlapping docs. v1 may *propose* a merge target and stage a draft, but a human performs/approves the merge in the PR. No blind content merges.
- Net-new full-vault one-time prune as a separate batch (the weekly cadence subsumes it over time).

## 4. Architecture

The process runs **inside the PM app** (Next.js on Vercel), reusing the existing Slack bot (`lib/bot/`, `app/api/bot/`), the GitHub vault helpers (`lib/github/vault.ts`), the LLM integration, and Vercel cron (`vercel.json` already schedules `sop-analysis`). The standalone Python audit script remains for local/manual full audits but is not on the weekly path.

### Why not Vercel Workflow DevKit or the Chat SDK
The "wait days for a human to reply" is **not** a paused function — it is an event-driven callback. Slack button clicks POST to an interactions webhook that acts independently; all durable state lives in **frontmatter + the author's branch**, so there is nothing to "resume." Event-driven + externalized state is simpler than a durable-workflow runtime and avoids a framework migration. The existing `slack-chatbot` covers delivery; no Chat SDK swap.

### Components
1. **`/api/cron/vault-consolidation`** (Vercel cron, weekly) — the trigger. Does **one** bulk fetch of the vault (tree + frontmatter), builds a **global backlink map**, and stores this as a single **run snapshot** (KV/Blob, keyed by `runId`). Then enumerates changes and stable docs and fans out, doing **no** per-doc processing inline (avoids the function timeout *and* a flood of GitHub API calls).
2. **Queue** (Upstash QStash or Vercel Queues) — one message per stable doc, processed independently with retries. Each message carries a **reference** (`runId` + doc path), **not** the backlink map inline — keeping messages small (well under the ~1 MB queue payload cap) and the map computed once.
3. **`/api/vault/consolidation/process`** (queue consumer) — for one doc: read the run snapshot (single cache read, no GitHub calls), run audit heuristics against it, generate questions (LLM only where needed), resolve author, send the Slack Block Kit card. The card carries the doc's current **blob SHA** (from the snapshot) for optimistic locking (§13).
4. **`/api/bot/slack/interactions`** (Slack interactivity webhook) — handles button clicks / text replies; re-checks the doc's blob SHA before mutating (§13); commits the resulting change to the **shared weekly branch**; patches frontmatter; updates the card.
5. **Change-report publisher** — posts the weekly digest to a Slack channel.
6. **Audit module** (`lib/vault/audit.ts`) — deterministic classification shared by the consumer (and portable to/from the Python script's logic).

## 5. Weekly flow

```
Vercel cron (weekly)
 1. CHANGE DETECTION  git log over the vault (GitHub API) since last run date
                      → new / modified / moved / deleted docs
 2. CHANGE REPORT     digest posted to a Slack channel (read-only)
 3. STABILITY GATE    docs whose latest commit is > 7 days old, excluding review_status: snoozed
                      and docs already reviewed since this cycle started
 4. SNAPSHOT + FAN OUT build run snapshot (tree + frontmatter + backlink map); one queue message per
                      stable doc, each carrying { runId, docPath } only
 ── per doc (queue consumer) ──
 5. AUDIT + QUESTIONS read snapshot; heuristics (orphan? duplicate? inbox? no-provenance? stale?) → question
                      set; LLM phrases; cap 5 cards/author (overflow → digest card)
 6. AUTHOR ROUTING    owner: frontmatter → else last committer → else PM fallback; git email → Slack ID
 7. SLACK DM          Block Kit card with action buttons; card carries the doc's blob SHA
 ── per answer (interactions webhook) ──
 8. APPLY             verify blob SHA unchanged in weekly branch (else abort+warn); commit to
                      vault-consolidation/<isoweek>; patch frontmatter
 9. CLOSE OUT         per-author "done" flag; one shared weekly PR opens at cycle end
```

## 6. Change detection (git, not mtime)

"Modified in the past 7 days" = **no git commit touched the file in the last 7 days**. Filesystem mtime is unreliable (clones/checkouts/Obsidian re-saves reset it). Git is deterministic and is already the source of truth. Detection uses the GitHub commits API over the vault repo since the last run's timestamp (stored as a cron run marker).

## 7. Author routing

Precedence for "who owns this doc's questions":
1. `owner:` frontmatter field, if present (ultimate source of truth).
2. Else the **last committer** of the file (the person who most recently touched it).
3. Else the **PM fallback** (existing `app_settings` PM Slack ID).

A small **git-email → Slack-ID mapping** is required (extends the existing `app_settings` Slack-ID storage). Unmapped authors fall through to the PM fallback.

## 8. Question generation

Deterministic audit heuristics decide *which* questions are worth asking; the LLM only **phrases** them with context (and only interprets free-text replies). Heuristic → question examples:

| Heuristic signal | Question offered |
|---|---|
| Zero inbound backlinks (orphan) | "Nothing links here. Still needed? If so, what should point to it? / Archive?" |
| Overlaps an existing canonical doc | "Looks like it covers the same ground as [[X]]. Merge into X, or distinct?" |
| Sits in `01_Inbox/` and is stable | "Settled. Approve as a future feature? File to suggested home? Keep researching? Drop?" |
| Missing `source:`/`status:` | "What repo/code does this describe (for `source:`)? Or is it `conceptual`?" |
| `updated:` predates source repo push (stale) | "Source has moved since last review — reconcile, or mark `legacy`?" |
| Empty / near-empty | "This is effectively empty. Delete, or is it a placeholder you'll fill?" |

Most carry a deterministic button action; "Reply with text" is the LLM escape hatch.

## 9. State model

**Durable document state → frontmatter** (read identically by the PM app and the Python audit):

```yaml
---
review_status: stable        # stable | reviewed | snoozed | active
last_reviewed: 2026-06-16    # date the author last answered for this doc
owner: chad                  # optional; routes future questions
---
```

**Ephemeral interaction state → a disposable store** (`vault_review_sessions` table or KV): maps a Slack interaction (`block_id` / message ts) → doc path → author → the shared weekly branch → open question, plus the doc's **blob SHA at question-generation time** (the optimistic-lock baseline, §13) and each author's **"done" flag**. Cleared when the weekly PR opens. This is UI plumbing for a stateless webhook, *not* a shadow copy of vault state.

The rule: **durable truth in frontmatter; in-flight routing in the disposable store.**

**Frontmatter writes must be surgical.** The programmatic frontmatter editor touches only the keys it owns (`review_status`, `last_reviewed`, `owner`) and preserves the rest of the YAML block (key order, comments, spacing) and **everything below it** (the doc body, Obsidian block properties, trailing newlines) byte-for-byte. Use a frontmatter-preserving editor, not a naive YAML load/dump that reorders keys or strips structure — the vault's Obsidian conventions (`CLAUDE.md`) depend on it.

## 10. Slack interaction model

One Block Kit card per stable doc, sent as a DM:

```
📄 RFC Vault as Agentic Wiki.md  ·  stable 12d
⚠ Orphan: nothing links here.  Suggested home: Feature Planning/
[ Approve as feature ] [ File to suggested home ] [ Merge into… ▾ ] [ Archive ] [ Snooze 7d ] [ Reply ]
```

- Each button is a `block_action` → `/api/bot/slack/interactions`.
- The webhook resolves `block_id` → doc/author/branch + baseline blob SHA via the ephemeral store, **verifies the SHA still matches** the file in the weekly branch (§13), then applies the change, patches frontmatter, and updates the card in place (✓).
- "Reply" opens a text input; only that path invokes the LLM to interpret intent.
- A final "Done for this week" control sets the author's done flag (it does not open a PR by itself).

**DM volume cap.** At most **5 individual cards per author per cycle** (configurable). Any overflow collapses into a single **digest card** — a concise list of the remaining docs with compact controls (and, as an optional stretch, a link to a PM-app triage view). This prevents flooding an author who owns dozens of old stubs.

## 11. PR strategy

- **One shared branch per week** for the whole team: `vault-consolidation/<isoweek>` (e.g. `vault-consolidation/2026-W25`).
- Every author's answered questions commit to this single branch, so edits are **cumulative and linear**. This is deliberate: a backlink rewrite from one author's action (e.g. archiving a heavily-linked glossary term) often modifies files "owned" by others; isolated per-author branches would diverge and conflict on those shared targets. A shared branch makes link-graph rewrites conflict-free before the human gate.
- **One consolidated weekly PR** opens at cycle end (when all flagged authors have set their "done" flag, or at a deadline). Its body is **grouped by author** so each person still owns and can review their own section; authors can be added as reviewers for their portion.
- The PR is the single human gate that protects the link graph — nothing lands unreviewed in v1.
- *Tradeoff accepted:* one team PR instead of per-author PRs, in exchange for conflict-free cumulative link rewrites.

## 12. Link safety

Moves, merges, and deletes must not silently break the Obsidian link graph (the vault's core value):
- Before any move/delete, compute inbound backlinks (`[[target]]` references).
- A **move** rewrites all inbound `[[old path]]` links to the new path in the same commit.
- A **delete/archive** with inbound links surfaces those links in the question ("3 docs link here") and repairs or reports them rather than orphaning them.
- All edits follow the vault's Obsidian conventions (no leading H1, wikilink files not folders, frontmatter validity).

## 13. Error handling & edge cases

- **Function timeout** — avoided by the cron→queue fan-out; each doc is its own retried job.
- **Multi-author week** — resolved by the owner-precedence rule (§7).
- **Unmapped / departed author** — falls through to the PM fallback.
- **No answer** — no change is made; the doc stays `stable` and re-surfaces next cycle. After N unanswered cycles it escalates to the PM (threshold is a future rule, §15). Snooze is an explicit author action, never automatic.
- **Snooze** — an explicit author action that sets `review_status: snoozed` with a 7-day expiry; excluded from the next cycle.
- **Concurrent human edit** — if a doc receives a new commit mid-cycle it becomes `active` and drops out of the next cycle's gate until it stabilizes again.
- **Stale interaction (optimistic locking)** — a card may sit in a DM for days. The card carries the doc's **blob SHA** captured at question-generation. On a button click, `/api/bot/slack/interactions` re-reads the file's current blob SHA **in the weekly branch** (which may already have changed from an earlier action this cycle, so `main` is not sufficient). On mismatch it **rejects the mutation**, replaces the card with a warning ("This doc changed since this card was generated — regenerating next cycle"), and commits nothing. This prevents an answer from acting on content the author never saw.

## 14. Testing

- **Audit module** (`lib/vault/audit.ts`) — unit tests over fixture doc sets asserting each classification (orphan, duplicate, empty, stale, no-provenance).
- **Author routing** — unit tests for the owner → last-committer → PM precedence.
- **Interaction handler** — tests that a given `block_action` produces the correct frontmatter patch + branch commit (GitHub API mocked), and that a **blob-SHA mismatch aborts** with no commit (optimistic locking, §13).
- **Snapshot + backlink map** — tests that the cron builds a correct global backlink map and that consumers read it without further GitHub calls.
- **Frontmatter editor** — tests that a surgical key update leaves the rest of the YAML block and the doc body byte-for-byte intact.
- **DM cap** — tests that >5 flagged docs for one author collapse into a single digest card.
- **Change detection** — tests over a fixture git history (since-date filtering, rename/delete handling).
- The deterministic core is fully unit-testable; the Slack UI and cron wiring get thin integration coverage.

## 15. Open questions / future rules

- **Additional consolidation rules** beyond the 7-day stability gate (the user noted more will come): e.g. size thresholds, doc-type-specific cadences, "N weeks unreviewed → escalate to PM."
- **Change-report richness** — plain git digest vs. an LLM one-line summary per changed area.
- **End-of-window** — does "Done for this week" require an explicit click, or auto-open the PR after a deadline?

These do not block v1 and are captured for the implementation plan / piece-2 design.
